CC11xx is a series of RF transceiver ICs from Texas Instruments.  The
particular parts used by these designs are CC1110 and CC1111, both of which
integrate an 8051 microcontroller.  The CC1111 additionally has an integrated
USB device peripheral.

This repository contains a number of projects which use cc11xx chips (Yard
Stick One, ToorCon 14 Badge, etc.) plus some useful stuff for working with them
(KiCad library including schematic symbol and PCB footprints).
